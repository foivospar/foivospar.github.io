Hi! I am a PhD student at the [Department of Computing](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/computing/), [Imperial College London](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/), advised by Prof. [Stefanos Zafeiriou](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/s.zafeiriou). My research interests revolve around Computer Vision and Machine Learning, with a focus on 3D reconstruction, photo-realistic rendering and editing of human faces with generative models. Currently, I am also a Student Researcher at Google in London. In the past, I was a research intern at Huawei Technologies R&D, UK. Prior to starting my PhD, I did my undergraduate studies at the National Technical University of Athens, where I was supervised by Prof. [Petros Maragos](https://robotics.ntua.gr/members/maragos/) and Dr. [Anastasios Roussos](https://users.ics.forth.gr/~troussos/) during my thesis.
